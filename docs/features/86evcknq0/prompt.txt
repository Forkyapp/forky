You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

**Task ID:** 86evcknq0
**Title:** Add Activity Log Page
**Description:**
Description:
Create a page that displays a user’s recent actions within the app, such as login times, profile updates, or settings changes. The goal is to improve transparency and give users visibility into their account activity.
Objectives:
Build an “Activity Log” page accessible from the user’s profile menu.
Display actions in a table or list format with action type, description, and timestamp.
Show the 20 most recent activities by default, with pagination or “Load More.”
Include filtering by date range and activity type (e.g., login, update, delete).
Ensure the layout is responsive and easy to read.
For now, use mock data or a simple API that returns sample activity entries.
Acceptance Criteria:
Activities load correctly and display all required details.
Filters work and update the list without full page reload.
Pagination or “Load More” works smoothly.
Empty state is shown when no activities are found.
Code is clean, modular, and ready to connect to a real backend later.

Your job is to analyze this task and create a detailed feature specification. DO NOT include any code implementation.

Please provide:

1. **Feature Overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What needs to be built
   - Why it's needed
   - Expected outcome

2. **Files to Modify** (CRITICAL - Be Specific)
   List exact file paths that need to be created or modified:
   - `path/to/file.js` - What changes are needed
   - `path/to/another.js` - What changes are needed
   - Include both new files and existing files to modify
   - Use relative paths from repository root

3. **Technical Approach** (4-6 bullet points)
   - High-level architecture decisions
   - Which parts of the codebase will be affected
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Potential challenges

4. **Implementation Steps** (numbered list)
   - Break down into logical steps
   - Reference specific files from "Files to Modify" section
   - Order of implementation

5. **Testing Strategy** (3-4 bullet points)
   - What should be tested
   - Types of tests needed
   - Edge cases to consider
   - Which test files to create/modify

6. **Acceptance Criteria** (checklist)
   - Specific requirements that must be met
   - Definition of done
   - How to verify the feature works

Format your response in clear Markdown. Be specific about file paths and changes. Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no code).
